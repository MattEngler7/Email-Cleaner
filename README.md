# Email-Cleaner(Updated)
Pretty self explanatory. It will ask permission to access your email and be able to read and delete your emails for you. It will scan through your emails and look for unread emails and delete them. **Make sure you have gone through your email and read the ones you think are important**, the program will do the rest and delete those junky ones that are cluttering up your email.

With the new update I implemented the choice for the user to decide if they would like to delete all unread emails or only ones that are over a month old. This gives the user the choice, if they would like a clean email box with no red notifications, saying they have unread emails. 

**RUN THE CODE IN YOUR TERMINAL USING**:
  **python3 email_cleaner.py**

**THINGS TO INSTALL IN YOUR TERMINAL USING PIP OR PIP3**:
  install **pytz** |
  install **google-api-python-client** |
  install **google-auth-oauthlib**
