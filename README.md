Pretty self explanatory. It will ask permission to access your email and be able to read and delete your emails for you. It will scan through your emails and look for unread emails and delete them. **Make sure you have gone through your email and read the ones you think are important**, the program will do the rest and delete those junky ones that are cluttering up your email.
